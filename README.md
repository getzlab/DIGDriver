# Welcome to Dig
Dig builds genome-wide maps of somatic mutation rates in cancer genomes and allows any set of candidate mutations to be tested for an excess of observed mutations compared to the number expected based on the neutral mutation rate.

## Web-browseable mutation maps
Want to visually explore somatic mutation rates across the genome? Check out our [genome browser](https://resgen.io/maxsh/Cancer_Mutation_Maps/views) genome browser with maps of predicted and observed mutation counts for 37 types of cancer.  

## Getting started
See our [wiki](https://github.com/maxwellsh/DIGDriver/wiki) for installation instructions and tutorials.

## Data files
All necessary data files are available from our [data portal](http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/DIG/downloads/)
