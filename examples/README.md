These scripts automatically run examples from https://github.com/maxwellsh/DIGDriver/wiki/05:-Analyzing-existing-annotations.

They can be executed on any environment with Bash. They require:

    * Dig to be installed.
    * 4-6Gb of unused memory.

Both `noncoding_driver.sh` and `mutation_driver.sh` can analyze different annotations by commenting in the relevant lines in the script.
